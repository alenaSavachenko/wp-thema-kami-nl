        <div class="blog-img-2" > <p>  The visual language that Kasia Mitan had developed as a draftsman
            by drawing lines, she could hardly translate it into paint.
            She turned that disadvantage into an advantage and she tries to bring those two forms together which is very innovative.
            She had it translated into color surfaces and special natural forms, concentrated purely on the paint and the action of painting. Within that partly self-created framework, paintings are created by reacting intuitively, emotionally and associatively to what happened during painting.
            happens on the canvas. Kasia's work evokes suggestion: the result partly depends on how the viewer experiences and interprets it. Kasia's work will sometimes appear semi-abstract and at other times evoke associations or memories.
            In her visual language she navigates between concrete conception and the evoking of dialogue and emotions of the recipient through the space given her own interpretation.</p>  </div>
